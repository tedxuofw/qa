In 2017, Jeff began a movement to end lunch shaming and find a permanent solution to the problem. Also known as the 'Lunch Dad,' Jeff launched a campaign to pay off all the lunch debt in Seattle, Tacoma and Spokane, the three largest school districts in the state of Washington. He has raised over $100,000 to date and is now aiming to pay off the lunch debt for every district in the state. Still, not everyone is aware of school lunch debt and the shaming that stems from it. Jeff is on a mission to raise awareness and find a way to end this practice once and for all.",
